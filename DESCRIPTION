Package: INLAOutputs
Type: Package
Title: Process selected outputs from the 'INLA' package
Depends: R (>= 3.5), INLA
Description: Functions to return fixed and random effects, calculate measures
    of godness-of-fit and predictive performance, calculate random effects in
    excess, and calculate the proportion of variance explained by each
    component of variance. The functions to process random effects accept more
    than one model and process all random effects of each model. The functions,
    to calculate measure of godness-of-fit and predictive preformance also
    accept more than one model and return models in order given by the
    performance.
